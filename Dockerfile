#
# p2p-hiverelay — P2P relay backbone for the Holepunch/Pear ecosystem.
#
# Multi-arch (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) — designed for Umbrel Home (ARM)
# AND x86 Umbrel/server hosts. Built via `docker buildx build --platform`.
#
# Multi-stage build:
#   Stage 1 (deps):    install production deps for all workspaces
#   Stage 2 (runtime): minimal Debian bookworm-slim runtime, non-root user, tini PID 1
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t p2p-hiverelay:latest .
#
# Multi-arch build (push to registry):
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
#     -t hiverelay/hiverelay:0.6.0 -t hiverelay/hiverelay:latest --push .
#
# Quick run (data volume + API port published):
#   docker run -d --name hiverelay \
#     -v hiverelay-data:/data \
#     -p 9100:9100 \
#     p2p-hiverelay:latest
#
# Open the TUI (connects to the running container's API):
#   docker exec -it hiverelay hiverelay tui
#
# Environment overrides:
#   HIVERELAY_REGION=NA           (region code)
#   HIVERELAY_MAX_STORAGE=50GB    (accepts human-readable sizes)
#   HIVERELAY_API_KEY=...         (secures management endpoints)
#   HIVERELAY_API_PORT=9100       (API port inside container)
#   HIVERELAY_HOLESAIL=1          (enable Holesail for NAT traversal)
#   LNBITS_URL=http://...         (LNbits payment provider; auto-detected on Umbrel)
#   LNBITS_ADMIN_KEY=...          (LNbits admin key for invoice creation)

# ─── Stage 1: dependencies ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Use Debian bookworm-slim (glibc) instead of Alpine (musl). Two upstream
# Bare ecosystem packages — udx-native, sodium-native — ship prebuilt
# binaries for `linux-x64`/`linux-arm64` (glibc) but NOT for
# `linux-x64-musl`/`linux-arm64-musl`. On Alpine, require-addon detects
# musl via /etc/alpine-release and looks for a musl prebuild that doesn't
# exist → crash at first import. Building from source on Alpine works
# but requires cmake-bare/cmake-napi + python3 + make + g++ in BOTH
# stages (the binary lands in a path require-addon doesn't search by
# default) and roughly doubles the runtime image. Debian bookworm-slim
# is ~50 MB larger than Alpine but loads the glibc prebuilds directly.
#
# Tracked in issue #21. Reconsider when udx-native ships musl prebuilds:
#   https://github.com/holepunchto/udx-native
#
# Node 22 LTS — Bare/Pear runtime targets stay aligned.

# start as root, fix ownership only when it's wrong (cheap on restarts), and
# drop to the unprivileged `hiverelay` user via gosu before exec'ing node.
