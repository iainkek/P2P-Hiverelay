/**
 * Load / concurrency integration tests for DHTRelayWS.
 *
 * These exercise the transport against many concurrent WebSocket clients
 * to verify rate-limiting, capacity tracking, responsiveness, and clean
 * shutdown all hold up under realistic load. We don't run a real DHT
 * handshake here — for these scenarios, we only care that the WS server
 * accepts/rejects connections and tracks them correctly. The dht-relay
 * `relay()` call inside the transport is invoked with a stand-in DHT;
 * since the client never speaks the framed dht-relay protocol, that path
 * is effectively a no-op past the WebSocket layer.
