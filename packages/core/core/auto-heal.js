/**
 * AutoHeal — diversity-enforced replica maintenance for archive-tier drives.
 *
 * Background scheduler that watches for archive-tier drives whose live
 * replica fleet has dropped below a diversity threshold and recruits this
 * relay as a fresh replica when doing so would meaningfully restore
 * diversity. Operates on cross-relay capability data already gathered by
 * the federation layer — it doesn't introduce new wire traffic; it just
 * computes a different decision over the existing data.
 *
 * Defaults target durable archival (≥7 replicas across ≥4 regions and ≥5
 * distinct operators). All thresholds are configurable via constructor
 * opts so operators can tune for their network density.
 *
 * State model:
 *
 *   For each archive drive seen via the cross-relay catalog:
 *     - Map<appKey, ReplicaSet>
 *     - ReplicaSet = { relayPubkey → { region, anchored, lastSeen } }
 *     - lastSeen pruned after `staleMs` (default 24h)
 *
 *   On each tick:
 *     1. Refresh ReplicaSets from the local app-registry catalog AND from
 *        peer-fetched catalogs cached on `node.federation`.
 *     2. For each archive drive: compute current (replicas, regions, operators).
 *     3. If below any threshold, decide whether THIS relay should recruit
 *        itself (would it improve diversity? do we have capacity? does
 *        accept-mode allow it?).
 *     4. If yes → call node.seedApp() with the same durability tier.
 *
 * What this is NOT:
 *   - Not a global coordinator. Every relay runs the same logic
 *     independently. Convergence comes from the diversity scoring: a relay
 *     in an over-represented region won't recruit itself, while one in an
 *     under-represented region will. Eventually the threshold is met.
 *   - Not a guarantee. Relies on at least one peer having the data
 *     reachable; can't rebuild a drive nobody has.
 *   - Not a replication protocol. Replication itself runs through the
 *     existing Hyperdrive + Hyperswarm path. AutoHeal just decides when to
 *     ask the local relay's seedApp() to start that replication.
